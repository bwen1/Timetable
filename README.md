Final commits in branch 'master' have left application not working as intended.
I've created a new branch, 'assignment_three_master', from an earlier commit 555cc123
and applied some small changes to it. It for the most part works as intended.

Please use branch 'assignment_three_master' for marking purposes and demoing of the application.
Due to lack of knowledge about how git works I was unable to apply these changes to 'master'.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
